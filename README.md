# PROJECT-2: 4-Seasons Hotel
Brian Patterson - Devan Babcock - Aaron Johnston

## Description

We have created a hotel site that was inspired by the 4-Seasons hotel. This a site that allows you to view accommodations and amenities for the locations provided by the line of hotels. You are able to choose your location, check-in, create an account, and check-out, all from the comfort of your own computer by visiting our website.

# Technologies Used:

We built the 4-Seasons hotel site using technologies consisting of HTML/EJS, Javascript, CSS, json, Express Heroku and node laying out the framework of the site. Used MongoDb to add database to our site.

# Getting Started:

You browse the site by clicking the hotel that you would like to research. Once in the the show page of the hotel, you pick which room, then check in. YOu will then be prompted to create an account if you have not already created your account to be able to check out. From the Accounts page, you can reach your personal account where you can check out from your stay.

# Next Steps:

We plan to incorporate authorization to the front desk to allow quick-access to check clients out of rooms.
